TYPO3 Installation
------------------

The following steps are required to active the frontend editing for a TYPO3 installation.

#. Install and active the extension called **frontend_editing**

#. Add the typoscript-static-template called **TYPO3 frontend editing** to the site roots where the features should be activated

|img-add-typoscript|

#. After the inclusion of the typoscript settings there is a need to add the following setting to the site root(s)

   Add this to the setup part, where the 1 or 0 indicates if it is active or not

.. code-block:: typoscript

   config.tx_frontend_editing = 1

#. The last thing to do is for the individual users to activate the frontend editing for themselves. This is done in the "User settings" in TYPO3:s backend.
