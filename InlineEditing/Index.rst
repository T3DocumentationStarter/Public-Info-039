Inline editing
==============

After the frontend editing have been activated from within TYPO3Â´s backend there are a scenario that needs to been taking into account. It is what kind of templating engine are used for the frontend template for the websites that you are using.

CSS Styled Content (css_styled_content)
---------------------------------------

If the installation are using the well known (and old) extension which is called css_styled_content are being used. The functionality comes straight out of the box and the editing can start directly.

Fluid Styled Content (fluid_styled_content)
-------------------------------------------

When it comes to fluid_styled_content there are some things that needs to be adjusted to your template to get the editing to work. First of all there is a view helper that needs to be included and configured.

First import the namespace:

.. code-block:: php

   {namespace fe=TYPO3\CMS\FrontendEditing\ViewHelpers}

Next step is to find the content that you want editable and wrap it with the view helper:

.. code-block:: html

   <fe:editable table="tt_content" field="bodytext" uid="{item.uid}">
       {item.bodytext}
   </fe:editable>

The output would then look like the following in frontend edit mode:

.. code-block:: html

   <div contenteditable="true" data-table="tt_content" data-field="bodytext" data-uid="1">
       This is the content text to edit
   </div>

While not in frontend edit mode the output are the following:

.. code-block:: html

   This is the content text to edit

TypoScript
----------

If you are listing elements with TypoScript only, you can still include the editing icons using the included hook into TYPO3 rendering process. This example lists editable the frontend user names and emails:

.. code-block:: typoscript

   page.20 = CONTENT
   page.20 {
     table = fe_users
     select.pidInList = 38
     renderObj = COA
     renderObj.10 = TEXT
     renderObj.10 {
       field = username
       wrap = Username:|<br/>
       stdWrap.editIcons = fe_users: username
       stdWrap.editIcons.beforeLastTag = 1
     }
     renderObj.20 = TEXT
     renderObj.20 {
       field = email
       wrap = Email:|<br/><br/>
       stdWrap.editIcons = fe_users: email
       stdWrap.editIcons.beforeLastTag = 1
     }
     stdWrap.editIcons = pages: users
     stdWrap.editIcons.hasEditableFields = 1
   }
